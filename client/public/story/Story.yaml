  - wizard says: "Ah, you must be new acolyte from the academy. Let's go over the basics."
  - wizard says: "You’re trying to create the most powerful spell, aren't you?"

  - wizard says: "You can see your current power up there."
  - wizard says: Spells are chaotic and difficult to control. Eventually your spell will become too chaotic and…
  - wizard says: …Well, you'll see.

  - wizard says: You can see its current chaos level up there.

  - wizard says: Oh, you've got some protective barrier charms!
  - wizard says: Thats good. Those are up here too.

  - wizard says: Some spells are also infused with elements. You can see hot/cold and light/dark up there.
  - wizard says: Hot and cold are opposed, as are light and dark. Imagine them like this….
  # show graph of elements
  - wizard says: But of course you've covered all of that at the academy. Now let's talk about what you're doing here…

  - show tower: WITH FADE

  # (Point to Add ingredients button)
  - wizard says: This is your tower, where you can add to your spell. 
  - wizard says: Your ingredients will infuse the spell with their essence.
  - wizard says: Be conscious of how many items you carry… Your pockets are only big enough for 7.

  # (Back to main selection screen, pointing to forage button)
  - wizard says: You'll have to go out and get new things to feed your spell. There are various options…
  # (Show forage option screen)
  - wizard says: The cold forest, the bright meadow, the dark cave, the burning volcano…
  - wizard says: Each area provides its own set of ingredients… I suppose it depends what you're looking for.

  # (Back to main selection screen, pointing to summon familiar button)
  - wizard says: Of course those in the arcane arts also have familiars. They run errands to their preferred habitat.

  # (Show familiar option screen)
  - wizard says: The Raven visits the forest, the Cat to a meadow, Spider to the cave, Salamander to the volcano.
  - wizard says: Don't forget to send them out to fetch… Familiars are always a little clingy.

  - hide ALL: WITH FADE
  - wizard says: Oh! One last thing.
  - show altar: WITH FADE
  - wizard says: Only when you summon or forage, you leave the spell unattended.
  - wizard says: "Chaos builds and builds(pause: 500).(pause: 500).(pause: 500)."
  - wizard says: But you'll probably be fine.
