# Spellcrafters of the Realm

Spellcrafter (working title) is both a physical card game and an on-chain game set in the Realms Autonomous World.

## Generating Cards 

If you want to play test the physical version you can produce all the cards from the `cards.csv` table.

Requires:
- python3
- make 

Run the command

```shell
make cards
```

This will dump the images in `cards-output`.
